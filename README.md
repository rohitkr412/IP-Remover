# IP Remover

- IP addresses are considered to be sensitive information in many organizations.
- It is compulsory to mask IP addresses in log files before retrieving them from the server at my work place.
- Opening log files one-by-one in Notepad and doing a 'Find-Replace' everytime is very repetitive.

IP Remover can mask all IP addresses. For Eg.
### 192.168.0.1 will be masked to x.x.x.x
