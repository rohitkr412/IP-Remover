I deal with a lot of log files that contain IP addresses at work.
IP addresses are considered sensitive information at my organization and it's compulsory to remove all IP addresses before retrieving them from the server.
It's boring to open them one-by-one in Notepad and do a 'Find-Replace' everytime.

So, I'm making a tool that can remove all IP addresses at the click of a button.
