# IP Remover

- IP addresses are considered to be sensitive information in many organizations.
- It is a good practice to mask IP addresses in log files before retrieving them from the server.
- Opening log files one-by-one in Notepad++ and doing a 'Find-Replace' everytime is very repetitive (Notepad++ can only open a few hundred MB of log files at a time).

IP Remover can mask all IP addresses without having the need to open them. For Eg. 
### 192.168.0.1 will be masked to x.x.x.x
